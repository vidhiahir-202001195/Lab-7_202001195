##Lab Session: Software Engineering

Section A:
Consider a program for determining the previous date. Its input is triple of day, month and year with the
following ranges 1 <= month <= 12, 1 <= day <= 31, 1900 <= year <= 2015.The possible output dates would be
previous date or invalid date. Design the equivalence class test cases?



### Test Cases:

| Test Case Id  | Day | Month | Year | Expected Output (DD/MM/YY) |
|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|5|5|2010|4/5/2010|
|2|19|12|2002|18/12/2002|
|3|1|6|1999|31/5/1999|
|4|24|7|2013|23/7/2013|
|5|1|5|2005|30/4/2005|
|6|1|3|2009|28/2/2009|
|7|1|1|2001|31/12/2000|
|8|29|2|2003|Invalid Date|
|9|31|4|2008|Invalid Date|


### Equivalence Class Testing:

#### Input Classes:

Day:
D1: Day between 1 to 28
D2: 29
D3: 30 
D4: 31

Month:
M1: Month has 30 days
M2: Month has 31 days
M3: Month is February

Year:
Y1: Year is a leap year
Y2: Year is a normal year 


#### Output Classes:

Decrement Day
Reset Day and Decrement Month
Decrement Year
Invalid Date

### Conditions for input classes to be valid:

Day:
| Partition ID | Range | Status |
|----------------------|-------|--------|
| E1 | Between 1 and 28 | Valid |
| E2 | Less than 1 | Invalid |
| E3 | Greater than 31 | Invalid |
| E4 | Equals 30 | Valid |
| E5 | Equals 29 | Valid for leap year |
| E6 | Equals 31 | Valid |

Month:
| Partition ID | Range | Status |
|----------------------|-------|--------|
| E7 | Between 1 and 12 | Valid |
| E8 | Less than 1 | Invalid |
| E9 | Greater than 12 | Invalid |

Year: 
| Partition ID | Range | Status |
|----------------------|-------|--------|
| E10 | Between 1900 and 2015 | Valid |
| E11 | Less than 1 | Invalid |
| E12 | Greater than 2015 | Invalid |
